# onestopbikes

I have build online bike info website with ReactJS and Redux. It fetch request from Json server. One can add comment in bikedetails of specific  bike and it get added to db.json.
To start json server open command prompt with db.json directory and type json-server --watch db.json -p  3001 -d 2000.
